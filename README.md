# MKS21X-FinalProject



Development Log:

Day 1 - (1/4/19)
  Experimenting with the TerminalDemo.java code to figure out how to use it in our project.
  We worked on early methods and constructors (set/get methods) for both Candy and CandyGrid classes.
Day 2 - (1/6/19)
We worked on methods that will check for matches of three or more candies of the same color. Still need to find a good way to store indices so you can later crush the candies.
