# MKS21X-FinalProject



Development Log:

Day 1 - (1/4/19)
  Experimenting with the TerminalDemo.java code to figure out how to use it in our project.
  We worked on early methods and constructors (set/get methods) for both Candy and CandyGrid classes.

Day 2 - (1/6/19)
We worked on methods that will check for matches of three or more candies of the same color. Indices are stored in a 2D ArrayList that is returned by the checkCols or checkRows methods.

Day 3 - (1/7/19)
We worked on the pop methods that delete candies that are the same color (3 or more in a row/col) and shifts down the candies that are above. Also had a helper method to fill in empty spaces in the CandyGrid.

Day 4 - (1/8/19)
We fixed the pop and check methods. We changed them so that they would only remove one set of candies at a time - so that when used in the game, the methods would be able to work continuously as the game was running. We also started working on the different pages in the game (menu, gameplay, etc).
